            My parents moved from the Philippines to the capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro,
            where I was born on Nov. 30, 1982. I lived there for the majority of my childhood til
            I was 13 when I moved to Daly City, CA for high school. My family moved to Stockton, CA
            where I attended the University of the Pacific and received my BFA degree in Graphic
            Design.
            <p>Ever since I was young, I've loved art and design. I've always had an interest in
            in developing websites. This interest eventually led me to the path of pursuing a career
            in software engineering.

            When I moved to Monterey, CA in 2012, I started going to the local rock gym and fell
            in love with climbing. This was the beginning of my fascination with the outdoors.
            I've been climbing indoors and outdoors for more than 10 years now. My goal is to end up
            coding for the outdoor industry.
